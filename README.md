# MuBu
Audio Player for an Interactive Museum Experience.

MuBu (short for Museum's Buddy) is a portable audio player that reads RFID tags in the museum space and plays the associated audio files.
Using a simple one-button user interface, visitors can choose from a variety of categories.

Feedback is provided to the visitors via a LED ring ligth on top of the device.

Simple naming conventions can be used to implement rudimentary logic, random file selection, and other diverse audio experiences for the exhibition space.

Thus, a variety of usage scenarios are conceivable:
- interactive scavenger hunts through an exhibition
- stimulating audio landscapes that encourage active viewing and thinking
- Non-linear storytelling for rich and personal experiences
